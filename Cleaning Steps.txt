Cleanup:
1. Major Cleaning steps like removing nulls, replacing N/A Values, Some Garbage data are replaced in tableau, PowerBI while loading data into the tool and performed Clustering and Visualization accordingly.
2. We do have some null values for age and we neglected those values.
3. There is one more visualization for "Confirmed cases by Country and Age" which is an Animated Bar Chart Race which we didn't take screenshot.
4. For clustering, we have linear values for most of our data. We tried making multiple clusters with different attributes.
5. For Naive Bayes, we took a different file. Which will predict the State(Isolated, Released, Deceased) of a COVID infected patient. To predict it we took Age, Sex and Country in our TestData.


Tools Used:
R-Studio(Naive Bayes)
Tableau(Clustering and Data Cleanup)
PowerBI (Data Cleanup and Visualization)
EXCEL (Minor modifications to the data files)
