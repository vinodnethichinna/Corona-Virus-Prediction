# Corono Virus Prediction.
Hi,

In this project, I worked on 2 datasets downloaded from Kaggle. The first one I used to make clusters and study the relationship between different variables. The second dataset is used to predict the state of a person based on age, sex, country. depending on training data our model will predict the state of a new person based on those columns. To achieve this I used the R - Naive Bayes model.

Please find the attached files which contain initial raw files and cleaned files, I am also attaching steps performed while cleaning and visualizations of clusters built-in tableau and R-Naive Bayes model code in a text file, make sure run this with R- Studio. additionally, I am also attaching PowerBi visualizations to clearly explain the relationship of various important columns.

Detailed PPT is also attached for reference.

Thank you.
